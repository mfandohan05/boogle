            <hr style="width:40%;">
            <p class="section-text">Time Bomb focuses on six different students from completely different
              backgrounds who all go to the same school - Diana, the daughter of a senator; Frankie,
              the town's superstar quarterback; Tad, his best friend with a secret involving Frankie; Cas,
              a girl who has been getting bullied  for her weight and looking for another way out; Z, a kid
              whose mom recently died of cancer; and finally Rashid, a Muslim boy who, facing indifference
              from his classmates, decides to do something about it. Through a freak bombing orchestrated
              by a student at the school, they all quickly develop one thing in common: they're trying to survive
              inside the destroyed school. <br>The story kicks off shortly after all six students are at school
              for one reason or another: for example, Rashid comes to shave his beard because he feels it has hindered
              him from being accepted at school. Shortly after, the first bomb goes off; it takes the students some
              moments to make it to the same room together. Three more bombs go off in succession; eventually, it
              is revealed that Diana was the perpetrator.</p>

                <hr style="width:40%;">
                <p class="section-text">I enjoyed this book; it's one of those books that thoroughly captured my attention from start to finish.
                The book was written so well that I could see everything playing in my head like a movie. Not only does the book make insightful commentary
                on the privacy of students, it even manages to discuss animosities between minorities welll one moment in particular comes to mind. Tad in the book is a mixed
                boy who is well aware of the struggles of being a minority. However, Rashid calls him out on allowing his friends to bully him despite knowing how it feels
                to be made fun of for something they can't help. This relates pretty strongly to one real life example of this: many people in the black
                community are homophobic, despite knowing how it can be being discriminated against for something you can't control.</p>

                <hr style="width:40%;">
                <p class="section-text">In the book, Diana's father is a senator who is trying to pass legislation that would allow
                  the government to access a student's personal e-mail account and social media if they have been reported to be "suspicious".
                  In universe, many characters address the legislation as invasive, while Diana adamantly defends it as "wanting to protect" the citizens
                  of the United States. The reason I made a parody of Google is because Google itself has had many privacy issues in the past. Many
                  people don't trust Google with their data, and believe the data they have on their visitors is invasive. The privacy issues that
                  are raised with Diana's father's legislation mirror that of real life. </p>
